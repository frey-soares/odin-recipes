    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Looking for something light <strong>AND</strong> tasty</p> for breakfast? This is one of my favorite breakfast recipes 
    due to the fluffy cottage cheese (which is jam packed with protein!) and the sweetness of all the fruit! It's almost like 
    a bowl of nature's candy without all the sugar! The best part is that it keeps me pretty filled up despite it being so light.
    Highly recommend! Let's jump right in!
